# Attendance System with Face Recognition using Python OpenCV

## Overview

This project is an Attendance System that utilizes face recognition technology implemented in Python using OpenCV. The system captures and analyzes faces from images or a webcam feed, recognizes them, and maintains attendance records.

## Features

- **Face Recognition**: Utilizes OpenCV to detect and recognize faces.
  
- **Attendance Tracking**: Records attendance based on recognized faces.

- **Image Storage**: Stores images in the `Images` folder for training and recognition purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library: Install using `pip install opencv-python`
- dlib library: Install using `pip install dlib`
- face_recognition library: Install using `pip install face_recognition`

## Folder Structure

The project structure includes:

- `Images`: Folder to store images for training.

- `F_REC.py`: The main script implementing the attendance system.
